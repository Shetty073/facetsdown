## facetsdown

### A program to download all wallpapers from [facets.la](http://facets.la). Written in python.


#### This is an improved version of [this](https://github.com/rafalstapinski/facets-downloader) code

#### Improvements I did to original code till now:
* Made python 3 compatible
* Changed the code a bit such that it now uses BeautifulSoup 4 instead of 3
* Some typeErrors fixed
* User gets a warning on start of app is now fixed
* Images are downloaded to "facets.la" folder (will be created if it does not exist) in the same directory in which your `facetsDown.py` is running

#### Future improvements:
* ~Need to fix a warning which we get while running this app~
* ~download to a specified folder~

### I love python... :)
